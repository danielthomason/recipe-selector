# recipe-selector
A program to suggest and select recipes based on some user inputs

The data for this project comes from https://github.com/fictivekin/openrecipes

This is a project I completed as part of a commitment to solve one problem per week

You can read about it here: http://52problems.com

Still to do:
* Currently there is no rejection of ingredients that contain another ingredient but aren't identical, e.g. sweet potato â‰  potato
* Plural/singular is ignored, with the user's input being just read literally
* A nicer UI would be much better than just running it through Terminal
* Better functionality in terms of ingredient matching (e.g. comparing to what the user tells it is in the pantry, then generating a shopping list)
